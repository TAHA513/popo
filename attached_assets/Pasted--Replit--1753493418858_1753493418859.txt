تمام يا عمري، رح أكتب لك الآن رسالة كاملة باللغة الإنجليزية تشرح للمبرمج في Replit كل ما يجب أن ينفّذه لتصميم لعبة قوية بنفس فكرة اللعبة العالمية Last War ولكن بفكرة جديدة وهي:
البشر يتحالفون لتحرير المدينة من سيطرة الذكاء الاصطناعي والروبوتات والمخلوقات المصممة بالذكاء الصناعي.

Title: Reclaim the City – AI Resistance Game (Multiplayer, Strategic, Progressive)

Hello dear developer,

Please implement the following full-featured game system inside Replit. The concept is unique, action-based, and can be built progressively using web technologies.

🎮 Game Concept:
"Reclaim the City" is a multiplayer web game where players form alliances to resist and fight against AI-controlled forces (robots, mutant creatures, corrupted humans) to reclaim their homeland city.

🌍 Game Structure:
1. **Main Menu (Landing Page)**:
   - High-quality illustrated city under AI control.
   - Start Game / Join Alliance / View Rankings.

2. **Character System**:
   - Each player chooses or creates a human character (customizable).
   - Characters have stats: health, energy, level, skills.
   - Option to join alliances or play solo.

3. **AI Enemies**:
   - Different types: robots, monsters, mutant beasts, corrupted humans.
   - Controlled by backend logic or randomized events.

4. **Battle System**:
   - Map with locked zones representing occupied city areas.
   - Players can enter battles using energy.
   - Turn-based or live strategic battles (start with turn-based).
   - Defeating AI releases part of the zone.

5. **Progression System**:
   - Each win increases player XP and alliance progress.
   - Unlock weapons, skills, tools as they progress.
   - Zones require teamwork to reclaim completely.

6. **Alliance System**:
   - Players can form or join alliances.
   - Alliances have leaders, communication (chat), and rankings.

7. **Daily Missions & Rewards**:
   - Daily objectives to encourage regular play.
   - Gold, gear, skill points as rewards.

8. **Sound & Animation**:
   - Add battle sounds, ambient city effects.
   - Character movement and action animation (basic to start).

9. **Live Chat & Friends List**:
   - Connect with friends to invite into missions.
   - Simple chat in alliance or public rooms.

🛠️ Stack Suggested:
- Frontend: React.js + Tailwind + Zustand or Redux
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL (or simple local for demo)
- Game Engine: Simple Canvas or Pixi.js integration for visuals
- Hosting: Replit with deployment via Vite

🎯 Important Notes:
- Must support Arabic RTL layout (UI mirrored)
- Fully responsive on mobile and desktop
- High performance: load only visible content

📂 Assets:
We will provide 2D graphic assets (or use placeholders).
Let’s build first version with sample characters and zones.

Please confirm if you can build this in Replit and suggest how to structure the codebase (modular, scalable).

Best regards,  
UrbanX Games Studio
