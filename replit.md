## System Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript architecture with clear separation between client and server code.

### Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for chat and WebRTC for local streaming (though streaming is de-emphasized)
- **Authentication**: Clerk-based authentication system with dashboard management
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for server bundling

### Key Components
- **Frontend**: Single-page application using wouter for routing, shadcn/ui with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS for styling, TanStack Query for server state, custom WebSocket hooks for real-time. Supports English and Arabic (RTL). Features enhanced MemoryCard component with 3D-style gifts and comprehensive privacy settings.
- **Backend**: RESTful API with Express, Passport.js for Replit authentication, PostgreSQL-backed sessions, and a WebSocket server for real-time interactions including chat and gifts.
- **Database Schema**: Includes Users, Streams (historical), Gift Characters, Gifts, Chat Messages, Point Transactions, and Followers. Expanded schema supports game rooms, player rankings, gardens, and premium features.
- **Data Flow**: Authentication via Replit OpenID Connect, sessions in PostgreSQL. Streaming (when active) handled via REST API and WebSockets. Gift system involves point purchases, client-side animations, and real-time notifications.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Clean grid layouts, professional appearance, minimal branding, intuitive navigation. Color scheme uses LaaBoBo brand colors (pink, purple, blue). Incorporates Instagram/TikTok-inspired elements where appropriate for specific features like video browsing or profile pages, but prioritizes a clean grid. Features enhanced 3D-style Memory Cards.
- **Feature Specifications**:
    - **Memory System**: Core content creation and sharing system where users can upload images, videos, and create posts with rich media support.
