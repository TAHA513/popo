# LaaBoBo Live - Live Streaming and Gift Platform

## Overview

LaaBoBo Garden (ÿ≠ÿØŸäŸÇÿ© LaaBoBo) is an innovative social virtual pet platform that revolutionizes social media interaction through virtual pet care and community engagement. The platform focuses on virtual pet ownership, social gardens, gift economies, and interactive community features without the complexity of live streaming. Each user owns a virtual pet (like "ÿ£ÿ±ŸÜŸàÿ® ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ±") in their digital garden, creating an emotional connection and encouraging daily engagement through care activities, social visits, and gift exchanges.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Design Preference: Clean, organized grid layout with professional appearance (NOT TikTok-style).
Content Display: Direct content visibility with minimal layout complexity.
Navigation: Creation buttons should be in profile/navigation, not prominently on main page.
Brand Elements: Minimal branding approach, focus on content over branding elements.

## System Architecture
