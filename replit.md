# LaaBoBo Live - Live Streaming and Gift Platform

## Overview

LaaBoBo Live is a full-stack live streaming application with a focus on interactive gift-giving and social features. The platform allows users to broadcast live streams, watch content from other creators, send virtual gifts, and engage through real-time chat. The application features a unique collection of animated gift characters with custom effects.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Design Preference: Clean, organized grid layout with professional appearance (NOT TikTok-style).
Content Display: Direct content visibility with minimal layout complexity.
Navigation: Creation buttons should be in profile/navigation, not prominently on main page.
Brand Elements: Minimal branding approach, focus on content over branding elements.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript architecture with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for live streaming features
- **Authentication**: Replit-based authentication system
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for server bundling

### Project Structure

3. User profiles are automatically created/updated on first login

### Streaming Flow
1. Streamers create live sessions through the REST API
2. WebSocket connections handle real-time viewer joining/leaving
3. Chat messages and gifts are broadcast to all stream participants
4. Viewer counts and gift totals are updated in real-time

### Gift System Flow
1. Users purchase virtual gifts using points
2. Gift animations trigger client-side effects
3. Points are transferred between users and recorded in transactions
4. Real-time notifications sent to all stream viewers

- **Role-based Access**: Users can have roles: 'user', 'admin', or 'super_admin'
- **Multi-layer Security**: Requires both super_admin role AND secret access code header
- **Temporary Promotion Route**: `/make-admin` for initial super_admin setup

The application is designed for deployment on Replit's platform but can be adapted for other hosting environments with minimal configuration changes.
